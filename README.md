# This is a basic MERN application ready to deploy with docker-compose up -build. 

# First go into each of the api and ui folders and npm install 
# Second make sure you have Docker installed and also VScode extension Docker Installed.

# Third make sure to update the docker files Node:$  where $ is equal to the current node version, right now both of the dockerfiles located in api/dockerfile and ui/dockerfile are using Node:12

# Fourth make sure to run docker-compose up --build 

# now you'll check the localhost:3000 to see react running with the back end and api all working together in separate containers.
